## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with discrete time Markov chains on a countably infinite
state space. It may be helpful to understand some basic properties of generating
functions, though definitions and examples will be provided.

## Introduction

A branching process, also known as a Galton-Watson process, is a model for growth
of a population over time. It is a branching stochastic process that
arose out of Francis Galton's statistical research on the extinction of a
family's last name.

Galton-Watson processes assume no distinction in sex (just as family names are
passed patrilineally). As a result, this model is widely used to examine
phenomena such as the transmission of the Y chromosome (paternal) or mitochondria
(maternal). Such branching processes are also used to model the population growth
of a bacterium that reproduces asexually.


## Key definitions in a branching process

### The offspring distribution

The offspring distribution, $\{p_k\}$, is the set of probabilities that an
individual will have $k$ offspring. It is given by,
$$\{p_k\}_{k=0,1,2,\dots} \quad \text{with } \; p_k \geq 0
                        \quad \text{and } \; \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k = 1.$$
Define $\mu$, the mean of the offspring distribution, as
$$\mu = \mathbb{E}[Z_n] = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k p_k$$
Let $Z_n$ be the size of a population at time (or generation) $n$. We assume
each individual reproduces **independently** of each other according to $\{p_k\}$.
Formally, let $\eta_j$ be the number of offspring individual $j$ has, where $j$ is
a member of generation $n$ and its offspring are a part of $n+1$. Then, the
number of individuals in the population at generation $n+1$ is,
$$Z_{n+1} = \sum_{j=1}^{Z_n} \eta_j \quad\quad \text{with } \;
                                    \mathbb{P}[\eta_j = k | Z_n = \ell] = p_k.$$
That is, the number of individuals of the next generation is the sum of the number
of offspring of all individuals in the prior generation. This model, then, assumes
that the organism dies after giving birth.

By requiring the conditional independence of the $\eta_j$'s given $Z_n$, $\{Z_n\}$
forms a Markov chain. The number of individuals of generation $n+1$ only depends
on how many individuals there are currently at time $n$.

### Extinction probability

Broadly, we are interested in determining how likely a given population is to go
extinct. Define the extinction probability, $P_e$, as,
$$P_e = \mathbb{P}[\text{ there exists } n \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } Z_n = 0 \;|\; Z_0 = 1]$$
If we start with one individual, we are interested in asking, will the population
go extinct? If so, can we infer how long extinction will take?

## Simulating a branching process

Before proving results about Galton-Watson processes, we can simulate these
Markov chains, $\{Z_n\}$, to get a general idea of answers to these questions.
$\{Z_n\}$ is essentially a tree, where each $i$ is a level with $Z_i$ nodes.

Let's assume we start with one individual, $Z_0 = 1$. And suppose each individual
reproduces with offspring distribution $\{p_k\} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$.

```{r}
simulate_bp <- function(num_generations, lambda) {
  total_individuals <- numeric(num_generations)
  total_individuals[1] <- 1             # 1 individual in the first gen

  for (i in 2:num_generations) {
    offspring <- 0
  
    for (j in 1:total_individuals[i-1]) {
      offspring <- offspring + rpois(1, lambda)
    }
    if (offspring == 0) {
      total_individuals[i] <- 0
      return(total_individuals[1:i])    # Early return if extinct
    }
    total_individuals[i] <- offspring
  }
  return(total_individuals)
}
```

#### $\lambda = 1$

The below code simulates 5 trials of 10 generations of a branching process with
offspring distribution Poission($1$). With $\lambda = 1$, some of the branching
processes go extinct, while others survive through the ten generations. Note that
$\mu = \mathbb{E}[\{p_k\}] = \lambda = 1$.

```{r}
num_trials <- 5
num_generations <- 10
lambda <- 1

run_trials <- function(num_trials, num_generations, lambda){
  for (trial in 1:num_trials){
    result <- simulate_bp(num_generations, lambda)
    print(result)
  }
}

trials <- run_trials(num_trials, num_generations, lambda)
```
#### $\lambda = 3$

Suppose we take $\lambda = 3$. None of the branching processes go extinct. In
fact, with a Poisson offspring distribution, we see very quick exponential growth
in the number of total individuals of the population. Intuitively, since the mean
of a Poisson distribution is $\lambda = 3$, each individual has $3$ offspring on
average.
```{r}
lambda <- 4
trials <- run_trials(num_trials, num_generations, lambda)
```
#### $\lambda = 0.5$

If we take $\lambda = 0.5$, you should be able to guess what is going to happen.
Since the mean number of offspring per individual is $\mu = 0.5 < 1$, the population
cannot be replaced and it goes extinct very quickly.
```{r}
lambda <- 0.5
trials <- run_trials(num_trials, num_generations, lambda)
```
Indeed, if $\mu$, the mean of the offspring distribution, satisfies $\mu < 1$, then
the probability of extinction, $P_e$, is $1$.

**Proof.**
Assume $Z_0 = 1$ and $\mu < 1$. Then, $\mathbb{E}[Z_n] = \mu^n \to 0$.

This equality follows because the average number of offspring of each individual
is independent. In generation 0, there is 1 individual. In generation 1, we expect
$\mu$ individuals. In the next generation, each of the $\mu$ individuals has $\mu$
offspring, so $\mathbb{E}[Z_2] = \mu^2$, and so on.

Also, $\mathbb{P}[Z_n \neq 0] = \mathbb{P}[Z_n \geq 1] \leq \mathbb{E}[Z_n] \to 0$.
Thus, $\mathbb{P}[Z_n = 0] \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$, as needed.

We call a branching process **subcritical** when $\mu < 1$. To understand the behavior
of a **critical** ($\mu=1$) or **supercritical** ($\mu > 1$) branching process,
we must discuss probability generating functions.


## Probability generating functions

For a random variable $X$, the probability generating function for $X$,
which I will denote $\phi$, with $s \in [0, \infty)$, is
$$\phi(s) = \mathbb{E}[s^X] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}s^k \mathbb{P}[X=k].$$
With a branching process, the probability that $Z_n = k$ is exactly $p_k$, so
$$\phi(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}s^k p_k.$$
is the generating function.

Observe that $\phi(0) = p_0$ and $\phi(1) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p_k = 1$.

### Extinction Probability: $\phi(s) = s$

We can now analytically solve the probability of extinction. The extinction
probability is given by the solution to $s = \phi(s)$.

**Proof Sketch.**

Let $P_e$ be the probability of extinction. For a population to go extinct,
one of two things must occur. If there is a single individual in the population,
then it must have $0$ offspring. This occurs with probability $p_0 = \phi(0)$ from the
offspring distribution.

Otherwise, each individual must form a branching process that is guaranteed to
go extinct at some point. Here, we start considering this process at generation $1$,
since the prior case covers if there is only one individual ($Z_0 = 1$). Given
$Z_1 = k$, the probability of each individual's branching processes going extinct
is $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P_e^k p_k$.

These are disjoint events, so $$P_e = p_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P_e^k p_k.$$

Observe that
$$\phi(P_e) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}P_e^k p_k = \phi(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P_e^k p_k
                                              = p_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P_e^k p_k.$$

That is, $\phi(P_e) = P_e$.

In fact, the extinction probability is the smallest solution to $\phi(s) = s$.
I defer the proof of this to UChicago professor Steven Lalley's notes. There is
also a more complete proof of this fact that relies on the continuity of $\phi(s) - s$
and the existence of a least element in the closed set $\{s \geq 0 : \phi(s) = s\}$.

### Example: Solving for $P_e$

Suppose an amoeba can either have $0, 1$, or $2$ offspring, which follows the distribution
$$\{p_k\} = (p_0, p_1, p_2) = \left(\frac{1}{10}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{3}{10}\right).$$
Note $\mu = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{10} + 1 \cdot \frac{3}{5} + 2 \cdot \frac{3}{10} = \frac{6}{5} > 1$,
so this is a supercritical branching process.

We have $\phi(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{2} p_k s^k = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{3}{5}s + \frac{3}{10}s^2$.
Solving $\phi(s) = s$, we find $s = \frac{1}{3}$ and $s = 1$. Taking the smallest
positive solution, $P_e = \frac{1}{3}$.

### $P_e$ for $\mu \geq 1$

We've seen that if $\mu < 1$, $P_e = 1$. And with this example, where $\mu > 1$, we
found a solution for $P_e < 1$. This happens to always be the case.

When $\mu = 1$, $P_e = 1$. A rigorous proof can again be found in Professor
Lalley's lecture notes, though I run $1,000$ trials of $5,000$ generations, and
nearly all eventually go extinct.

```{r}
frac_extinct_trials <- function(num_trials, num_generations, lambda) {
  result <- 0
  for (trial in 1:num_trials) {
    bp <- simulate_bp(num_generations, lambda)
    
    if (length(bp) < num_generations) {
      result <- result + 1
    }
  }
  return(result / num_trials)
}

num_trials <- 1000
num_generations <- 5000
lambda <- 1
extinction_prob <- frac_extinct_trials(num_trials, num_generations, lambda)
extinction_prob
```
So, only when an individual, on average, produces more than $1$ offspring, can
we find an extinction probability less than $1$.

## Closing remarks

This introduction showed how to simulate a simple branching process in R and
provided some key definitions and results such branching processes. However,
these calculations and theory are only useful when we know the offspring distribution,
$\{p_k\}$, which is rarely the case.

The next vignettes focus on inference for the offspring distribution given the
growth data of a population. From this estimated offspring distribution, we can
use the formulas and computations in this vignette (such as $\phi(s) = s$) to
estimate the probability that the population will eventually go extinct.
